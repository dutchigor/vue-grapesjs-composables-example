This is an example of how to use the [vue-grapesjs-composables](https://github.com/dutchigor/vue-grapesjs-composables) repository in a vue app.
Note that this example is not maintained as I am looking for someone to take over the vue-grapesjs-composables repository. Hopefully a new owner will take over this example as well.
